    * TODO: Adds a finalizer to this subscription, so that finalization will be unsubscribed/called
      when this subscription is unsubscribed. If this subscription is already {@link #closed},
      because it has already been unsubscribed, then whatever finalizer is passed to it
      will automatically be executed (unless the finalizer itself is also a closed subscription). Closed Subscriptions cannot be added as finalizers to any subscription. Adding a closed
subscription to a any subscription will result in no operation. (A noop). Adding a subscription to itself, or adding `null` or `undefined` will not perform any
operation at all. (A noop).`Subscription` instances that are added to this instance will automatically remove themselves
if they are unsubscribed. Functions and {@link Unsubscribable} objects that you wish to remove
will need to be removed manually with {@link #remove}
