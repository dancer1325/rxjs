 * ### Known Limitations
 *
 * - The {@link asyncScheduler} uses `setTimeout` which has limitations for how far in the future it can be scheduled.
 *
 * - If a `scheduler` is provided that returns a timestamp other than an epoch from `now()`, and
 * a `Date` object is passed to the `dueTime` argument, the calculation for when the first emission
 * should occur will be incorrect. In this case, it would be best to do your own calculations
 * ahead of time, and pass a `number` in as the `startDue`.
 * @param startDue If a `number`, is the time to wait before starting the interval.
 * If a `Date`, is the exact time at which to start the interval.

* `export function timer(startDue: number | Date, intervalDuration: number, scheduler?: SchedulerLike): Observable<number>;`
  * `intervalDuration: number`
    * by default, milliseconds
    * üëÄdelay between values / emitted | intervalüëÄ
    * if you pass a negative number -> AFTER emitting the FIRST value, IMMEDIATE completion

* `export function timer(dueTime: number | Date, unused: undefined, scheduler?: SchedulerLike): Observable<0>;`

* `export function timer(
  dueTime: number | Date = 0,
  intervalOrScheduler?: number | SchedulerLike,
  scheduler: SchedulerLike = asyncScheduler
): Observable<number> {}`
